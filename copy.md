## Text to put on my webpage once I write words good

### Intro Section
About
* Hey there, I'm Jake.

* I am a full stack developer with experience building websites and web applications.

* I've spent the past six years working around the United States in a variety of Industries. From wilderness therapy to mountain hospitality I've worn many hats. I've always been drawn to roles that connect humans to themselves and others.

* These days my time is spent learning how to build and deploy beautiful websites. I've always been interested in the convergence of creativity and problem solving. I'm learning how to best occupy that space. I design and build websites that look good and solve problems.

* When I'm not coding you can find me making music, hiking, and petting all the good dogs.

* I've always been driven to occupy the space where problem solving and creativity collide. In a previous lives working in wilderness therapy, hiking across the country, and working in the Huts of New Hampshire I faced all sorts of unique problems. How could I teach a young adult with a history of drug abuse how to create a fire using only sticks? How could I create a home for myself using only items that fit in your backpack? How do bake bread on top of a mountain? How do you create beautiful music with acoustic noises when you're in the middle of the woods and all you have is a digital instrument? These are questions that thrill me, and questions that lead me to answers that brought connection, fulfillment, and joy.  Solving the unsolvable using unique solutions is what gets me out of bed in the morning.

* When I write code I’m after the same feelings. I want to tackle problems with solutions that require a deviation from the status quo. As a developer, the tools I use are different, but the outcomes are the same. I write code that solves unique problems using creative solutions.

### Projects
Sweater Weather
*  I'm not too good with needle and thread, but I do love a cozy sweater. This project explores the capabilities of CSS by combining clip paths and stacked grid layouts to create an animated sweater that appears differently according to the window size.
Portland to Portland
* How can we make sure our page is accessible on any device? A foray into the world of responsiveness, this project fulfilled a Figma design and implemented media queries to ensure that the page appeared and functioned seamlessly across all device sizes.
Learning how to Learn
*  This project is an exercise in how to communicate information more effectively using design layouts. This pixel perfect page was my first exercise in transforming an idea to an interactive website.
Mondrian Grid
*  How can we write code to replicate iconic works of art? This project utilizes a grid layout with assorted cell sizes to create a responsive replica of an abstract piece by Piet Mondrian.
Personal Website
* The goal of this page is to display both my mission and work clearly and concisely in a way that catches the eye without sacrificing functionality. In the beginning of my development education, this website was an exploration in how to create a modern website using solely CSS.
Styled Form
* This project was an exercise in functional design. This project was a test to create a custom form with a unified design structure with elements that guide rather than distract the user.

### Future Projects
My best work has yet to be created
Your website
*  You deserve a website that communicates your personal brand to potential clients in a way that speaks to who you are and what you do. Designing and building something as unique as you are is no easy task, but I’m up to the challenge. Shoot me an email and let’s get the ball rolling your next steps.
Spotify x Strava
*  We can communicate everything about our fitness: Our heartbeat overtime, our pace relative to elevation, and even our feelings about each workout. I want to create a way to let our fitness network know what we listened to as during out workouts. Utilizing both the Spotify and Strava api’s I want to create playlists based on our Spotify history recorded during out workouts.
OP1 Grid
* I’ve fallen in love with the capabilities of both Flexbox and Grid. I want to try and create an abstract grid based on Teenage Engineering’s op-1. Who knows, maybe I’ll even make it a functional instrument.
